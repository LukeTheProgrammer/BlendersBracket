# BlendersBracket

This project was built for a friend who was going to do a bracket-style tournament to determine the next name for his newest product at his smoothie store.

Unfortunately, the project never got off the ground, but it was a lot of fun making and represented one of the most complicated pieces of code that I had created at that time.
